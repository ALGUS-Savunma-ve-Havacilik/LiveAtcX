{"name":"Liveatcx","tagline":"Simple Java Program to Stream Audio from the internet based on the station tuned in the FSX radios","body":"LiveAtcX is a super-primitive tool to allow live streaming of audio feeds based on the settings of the FSX radios.\r\nIt can be used to tune Live ATC or any stream while flying.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons for this tool:\r\n\r\n1. The joystick disconnect problem: Windows 8.1 users of FSX experience disconnects of USB devices when leaving the FSX window to focus on another program.\r\nOtherwise, it would be simple to tune these streams in a browser window.\r\n2. It is cool to have the plane's radio tuning real ATC when not using it for RC4 ATC or vatsim.\r\n\r\nNote: I've been able to fix the joystick disconnect problem - but it's still cool to use the radios.\r\n\r\nTo run, unzip the zip into a folder and run the run.bat file.\r\n\r\nTo customize feeds, create a file called liveatcx.properties in your home folder. On windows, that is in you user folder, not your documents or desktop.\r\n\r\nThe properties file contains the FSX simconnect host and port and then a list of frequency/url pairs.\r\n\r\nHere is the default built-in version that is used if you do not create your own file:\r\n\r\nhost=localhost\r\nport=9017\r\n132000=http://d.liveatc.net/zbw_remsen\r\n132100=http://d.liveatc.net/kblm1\r\n132200=http://d.liveatc.net/kpbi\r\n132300=http://d.liveatc.net/zjx_kmyr\r\n132400=http://d.liveatc.net/kmia_app\r\n132500=http://d.liveatc.net/kmia_twr\r\n132600=http://d.liveatc.net/kjfk_gnd_twr\r\n132700=http://d.liveatc.net/kjfk_app_final\r\n\r\nYou can find your favorite streams on liveatc.net and create your own liveatcx.properties file.\r\n\r\nLICENSES:\r\nThe jsimconnect library is LGPL. The rest of the source is unlicensed.\r\n\r\nDOWNLOADS: https://github.com/mikeberger/LiveAtcX/releases\r\n\r\n================================================\r\nTo build from source, you need the JDK and Maven.\r\nFrom the top folder, run: mvn clean package\r\n\r\nThis creates a zip file in the target folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
